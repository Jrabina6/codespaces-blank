      <hr>This movie is a thrilling watch. No matter what you're into, this movie is
      bound to keep you entertained. The non stop action on the flight deck
      combined with the drama and humor from the summer nightlife makes for a
      perfect movie. The intensity of flight school and high risk missions keep
      you on the edge of your seat. I thought that Tom Cruise did an outstanding
      job in this film which really brought it all together.
