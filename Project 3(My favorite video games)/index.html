          This movie is a thrilling watch. No matter what you're into, this
          movie is bound to keep you entertained. The non stop action on the
          flight deck combined with the drama and humor from the summer
          nightlife makes for a perfect movie. The intensity of flight school
          and high risk missions keep you on the edge of your seat. I thought
          that Tom Cruise did an outstanding job in this film which really
          brought it all together.

          As always, Adam Sandler proves to be one of the funniest actors
          around. I don’t think I stopped laughing until minutes after this
          movie ended. This comedy is the funniest movie I have ever watched.
          Besides the unmatched humor this feel good story of a mother son
          relationship is amazing. This is one of my favorite movies of all
          time.

          Once again, an Adam Sandler movie with unreal humor. This comedy is
          nothing more than non-stop laughter yet still it's an all time great.
          As Bobby Bouchet gets discovered as a mysteriously good tackler his
          puny role as waterboy transforms into the star player. Unfortunately
          for him his mom never let him play football, so he must keep a big
          secret. This is a must watch movie.

          This holiday classic is just as amazing every Christmas season. The
          chaotic house somehow forgets a family member at home for a week, and
          his journey through living alone is one of the more enjoyable things I
          have ever watched. I highly recommend this movie.
