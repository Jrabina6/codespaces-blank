    <h1>A review of HTML</h1>
    <p>
      HTML is really a very simple coding language. It consists of ordinary
      text, with elements that are enclosed by "<" and ">"characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best part about HTMl is that once we know how to effectively use basic
      elements, we can look up how to use all of the others!
